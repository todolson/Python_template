# Python_template
This is a simple template for Python scripts, to handle some basic boilerplate structure.

## Configuration
This template is set up for both command-line arguments and config file.
If either are not wanted, it should be easy to remove.

If this is an interactive script where you want prompted for command line arguments, the `argparse-prompt` package is a drop-in wrapper around for `argparse`, see https://pypi.org/project/argparse-prompt/
